Sam, the weak accomplice,
He knew he had a choice,
He always startled easily,
With the sound of every voice,

A pocket full of excess,
They take and take and take,
Left him with a trigger pointed,
Staring at his shakes,

And it goes on,
And it goes on,

She was given nothing,
But their selfish lack,
They sleep with one eye open,
‘Cause they know she’s coming back,

But she will wait her turn,
Absent from concern,
The furnace inside her,
It burns and burns and burns,

And it goes on,
And it goes on,

Weaklings never practice,
What they preach,
They cower down below,
That’s what you call defeat,
And in their darkest hour,
